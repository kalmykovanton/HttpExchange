# HttpExchange
Jazz Framework HttpExchange Component
## Intro
In the development of this component, namely the implementation of the 'PSR-7: HTTP message interfaces' recommendations, there were moments when the inspiration left me, I lost the thread and the realization came to a standstill. In such situations, I have found strength and drew new ideas for this project from the developers of the Zend framework, for which many thanks to these guys. Also many thanks to one of the PSR-7 developers Matthew Weier O'Finney, for the wonderful articles, that helped me become uproarious what's what. See [PSR-7: HTTP message interfaces](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/), [Zend-Diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros), [PSR-7 By Example](https://mwop.net/blog/2015-01-26-psr-7-by-example.html), [On PSR7 and HTTP Headers](https://mwop.net/blog/2015-07-28-on-psr7-headers.html), [PSR-7 And Middleware](http://weierophinney.github.io/2015-10-20-PSR-7-and-Middleware/#/). This vision of the PSR-7 does not apply for full implementation of recommendations, since, maybe something was not completely realized or lost, and some things have been adapted to our personal project, so —Åomments and criticism welcome. PSR-7 - it was not easy, but it works :+1:
